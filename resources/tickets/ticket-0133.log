[Mon Apr 08 50689 13:37:16 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: its new epic hoppers
[Mon Apr 08 50689 18:47:26 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: u can upgrade and it will suck all items around it in 3*3 area
[Mon Apr 08 50689 20:33:55 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: so u will not need many hoppers now
[Mon Apr 08 50689 22:10:23 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: 1 can do work of 9
[Tue Apr 09 50689 02:59:13 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: also left click to sync this hopper to other chest or hopper
[Sat Apr 13 50689 14:20:36 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  BlueJester (Micah R Maloney)#5854: Ah, gotcha...  Though, I had multiple chests before, for a huge collection, versus now fewer chests...  :/  How do I upgrade it?
[Mon Apr 15 50689 01:13:18 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: left click on it
[Mon Apr 15 50689 03:02:20 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: it cost 25k for each level
[Mon Apr 15 50689 04:18:38 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: max is level 5
[Mon Apr 15 50689 11:27:27 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: and 1 max level hopper can suck items from 16*16 means one chunk
[Tue Apr 16 50689 13:52:50 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  BlueJester (Micah R Maloney)#5854: *sighs*  It actually worked better with the previous vanilla for my setup...  A 3x3 of hoppers going to a total of 8 double chests.  And it was working until I accidentally broke the one corner hopper...
[Mon Apr 22 50689 00:26:39 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  BlueJester (Micah R Maloney)#5854: I mean, really, vanilla hoppers are cheap to mine and chop materials for, and 9 in a chunk is not causing much lag if any, especially with the /afk in donor perk not preventing me from getting kicked after an hour anyways...  25k for something inferior to what I already had just isn't worth it...  I'd have to completely rebuild my mob farm to compensate for losing the one hopper landing location, because the water pushes them down the chute.
[Mon Apr 22 50689 08:49:45 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  BlueJester (Micah R Maloney)#5854: I'm heading to bed because I need sleep...  But this just fouled up 3 days of work.
[Fri May 17 50689 15:00:22 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)]  Rex#1001: ok im gonna try to fiz
